# Finishing up
Now that you have installed Windows 10 there are a few more things that need to be done

#### 1. Install Drivers
- You will need to install your drivers, these are different for every set up but these are the main ones to look for
  - Drivers for your Motherboard
    - Your motherboard may have come with a Disc with drivers, these are typically out of date
      - If your internet is not connecting use the included disc to get things working then go to the manufacturers website to update them
      - If your internect is connecting without drivers then just go straight to the manufacturers website to download the drivers
  - Drivers for your Graphics card
    - As with the Processor, you will need to go to your Graphics card manufacturer's website and download the appropriate drivers
    - Note: Your PC may not have a dedicated graphics card, if that is the case ignore this step
  - Some keyboards and mice have drivers that need to be downloaded to access special functions but should still function normally without them

#### 2. Install Programs
- I recommend using [Ninite](ninite.com) to install most of your software
  - Ninite let's you choose from a lot of popular programs and adds them all to one installer
- You will have to install all other programs you want separately if they are not included in Ninite

#### 3. Enjoy your fresh install of Windows 10
